### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Emre Saritepe and I'm a data analyst with a neuroscience background. I really enjoy working with data to compare different strategies and uncover new discoveries from the unknown. I also enjoy working on data wrangling, data visualization, and statistical analyses. I have experience with Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, etc.), SQL, R, and Tableau. Feel free to check me out on LinkedIn at linkedin.com/in/emre-saritepe.
