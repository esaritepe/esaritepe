### Hello there 👋

*Data professionals shouldn’t just execute tasks — they should design systems with purpose and measurable impact.*

I’m a Data Engineer and Analytics professional with a strong foundation in analytics and data science, focused on building scalable, governed data platforms that replace manual workflows with reliable, production-grade data systems.

What I specialize in:

* Data engineering and analytics using Snowflake
* Building and maintaining ETL pipelines using Python and SQL
* Designing data warehouses, analytics layers, and dimensional models
* Implementing data quality checks, validation logic, and governance
* Delivering dashboards and internal tools that enable self-service analytics

In my previous role, I designed and delivered Snowflake-based data engineering and analytics solutions supporting clinical operations, resource tracking, and product data quality in a regulated environment. I worked end-to-end across the data lifecycle, including data modeling, SQL development, Python-based ETL pipelines, validation logic, and user-facing analytics.

I’ve driven initiatives to replace spreadsheet-driven processes with production applications, migrated legacy BI solutions to modern cloud data stacks, and supported clinical trial and product data pipelines where accuracy, traceability, and scalability are critical.

My background in applied data science, statistics, and machine learning allows me to collaborate effectively across data engineering, analytics, and modeling teams — whether enabling downstream ML workflows, optimizing queries, or clearly communicating technical trade-offs and insights to stakeholders.

𝐓𝐞𝐜𝐡 𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐜𝐤: Python, SQL, Snowflake, Streamlit, Power BI, Looker, Tableau, Git, Linux/UNIX, AWS (EC2), data warehousing, analytics engineering, machine learning.

I’m actively interested in Data Engineer, Analytics Engineer, Data Scientist, and Business Intelligence Engineer roles where I can help teams build trusted, scalable data systems that drive real business impact.
