### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

*Data analysts shouldn't just limit themselves to technical skills, but should also strive to be excellent storytellers and investigators.*

EXPERIENCE:
I am a data analyst with a neuroscience background who enjoys discovering new insights through data. 

I believe that data analysts shouldn't just focus on technical skills like Python, SQL, and Tableau; but also have the soft skills to investigate the unknown and become great data storytellers. 

I have 3+ years of experience in academic data analysis research with a focus on data modeling and data visualization. I have led investigative research to uncover new information on the effects of traumatic brain injury (TBI) on human executive functions. For this project, I set up a pipeline that reduces the amount of time to process and analyze raw MRI data. My biggest highlight was when I demonstrated that surface area had a 170% higher R-squared value than the more commonly used cortical thickness, paving the way for more reliable measurements in future neuroimaging research. 

PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE:
The majority of my previous experience with neuroscience research was determining the predictability of brain damage on cognitive functions within the data science lifecycle, including:
  * Data Collection within a UNIX Environment
  * Project Scoping and Proposing
  * Data Wrangling
  * Linear Regression Modeling and Statistical Analyses
  * Presentation to a Scientific Committee

PASSIONS:
Board Games | Film | Music | Walking | Soccer(Football)
